Q: What is this?

A: A repository for fvt, the command-line utility for generating fvtrees, using the fvtree library, which is also stored here.

Q: Okay, what's an "fvtree"?

A: They are simple, 2D trees (the wood kind), rendered in text.

Q: Why "fvtree"?

A: It sounded catchy. I couldn't think of a better name.

Q: Why did you use vec for the text_canvas? A HashMap would've been much easier to implement.

A: Space requirements? Mm. In hindsight a hashmap *would* have been easier...

Q: What's the specification for an fvtree?

A: *It's in development.*
